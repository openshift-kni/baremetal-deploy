# This variable serves two purposes, one: If the host being used as provisioner (automatically, the first host in your lab assignment) is not pre-installed with RHEL 8.1
# the playbook logs into this host to make hammer cli calls to mark the host for a build with RHEL 8.1. Two: If you are redeploying on an allocation with a previously installed
# OpenShift cluster, it might be better to start with a clean provisioning host, in that case also, the hammer_host variable is used to reprovision the system based on 
# rebuild_provisioner variable below. If you do not have access to this type of host for reprovisioning/making hammer cli calls, it is recommended that you start with a RHEL 8.1
# clean provisioning host (manually install RHEL 8.1 on the first host in your lab allocation), so that `hammer_host` is never needed
hammer_host: hwstore.example.com
