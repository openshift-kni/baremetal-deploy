= Configure network components to run on the control plane

Configure networking components to run exclusively on the control plane nodes. By default, {product-title} allows any node in the Machine Config Pool to host the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` virtual IP addresses. However, many environments deploy worker nodes in separate subnets from the control plane nodes. Consequently, you must place the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` virtual IP addresses exclusively with the control plane nodes.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory storing the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/clusterconfigs
----

. Switch to the `manifests` subdirectory.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd manifests
----

. Create a file named `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ touch cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml
----

. Open the `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml` file in an editor and enter a custom resource (CR) that describes the Operator configuration:

This manifest will place the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` virtual IP addresses on the control plane nodes. Additionally, the following processes will deploy on the control plane nodes only:
+
* `openshift-ingress`
+
* `keepalived`
+
* `openshift-monitoring`
+
* `imageregistry`
+
This manifest will also disable the following processes on worker nodes.
+
* `openshift-cluster-samples-operator`
+
* `marketplace` (remove default sources)
+
* `insights`

. Save the `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml` file and quit the text editor.

. Consider backing up the `manifests` directory. The installer deletes the `manifests/` directory when creating the cluster.
