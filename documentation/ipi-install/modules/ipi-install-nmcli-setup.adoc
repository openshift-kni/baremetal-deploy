====
The `ssh` connection may disconnect after executing this step. You will want to have some sort of out-of-band connection to your host (eg., a serial console, local keyboard, or dedicated management interface) in the event that something goes wrong while executing these commands.

The IPv6 address may be any address as long as it is not routable via the `baremetal` network.

Ensure that UEFI is enabled and UEFI PXE settings are set to the IPv6 protocol when using IPv6 addressing.
