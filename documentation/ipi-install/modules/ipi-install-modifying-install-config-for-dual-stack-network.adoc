= Modifying the `install-config.yaml` file for dual-stack network (optional)

To deploy an {product-title} cluster with dual-stack, make the following changes to the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
machineNetwork:
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet }}
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet6 }}
clusterNetwork:
- cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
  hostPrefix: 23
- cidr: fd02::/48
  hostPrefix: 64
serviceNetwork:
- 172.30.0.0/16
- fd03::/112
----

NOTE: In the above snippet, the values for the networks must match the ones for your own environment and that IPv4 details must go *before* IPv6 ones, having the `machineNetwork` two entries and same for the `clusterNetwork` and `serviceNetwork`.

We also need to deploy an additional manifest for enabling the FeatureGate with the following contents:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: IPv6DualStackNoUpgrade
