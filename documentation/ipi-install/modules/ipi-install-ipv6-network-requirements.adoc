.SLAAC Addressing

If you do not plan to use SLAAC footnote:[Stateless Address AutoConfiguration] addresses on your {product-title} node, then it should be disabled for `baremetal` networks, that means that if your network equipment is configured to send SLAAC addresses when replying to Route Advertisements that behavior should be changed, so it only sends the route and not the SLAAC address.

Install `ndptool` on your system in order to check what your RAs look like:

[source,shell]
----
# Turn down/up baremetal iface on a master Node
$ sudo nmcli con down "Wired connection 5" && sudo nmcli con up "Wired connection 5"
Connection 'Wired connection 5' successfully deactivated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/1983)
Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/2044)

# ndptool monitor on Helper node
$ sudo ndptool monitor -t ra
NDP payload len 80, from addr: fe80::c0a4:6464:bcb3:d657, iface: baremetal.153
  Type: RA
  Hop limit: 64
  Managed address configuration: yes
  Other configuration: no
  Default router preference: medium
  Router lifetime: 0s
  Reachable time: unspecified
  Retransmit time: unspecified
  Source linkaddr: 1c:40:24:1b:0c:34
  Prefix: 2620:52:0:1303::/64, valid_time: 86400s, preferred_time: 14400s, on_link: yes, autonomous_addr_conf: no, router_addr: no
  Route: ::/0, lifetime: 0s, preference: low
----

The `ndptool monitor` should report `Managed address configuration: yes`.

.Network Ranges and Configurations

Different `baremetal` and `provisioning` networks are required for each environment; each environment will have a different IPv6 range for each one of those networks.

In our configuration we used subinterfaces attached to two different physical interfaces, VLAN tagging was done at O.S. level (this required switch ports configured with `trunk` mode).

Our different IPv6 networks were all routable but usually, the only routable networks are the `baremetal` ones.

Keep in mind that `provisioning` networks cannot be in the same broadcast domain, since services such as DHCP are running.

[IMPORTANT]
.Route Advertisement
====
Route Advertisement must be enabled for both networks `baremetal` and `provisioning`.
====

.Route Advertisements

As mentioned previously, both the `baremetal` and the `provisioning` networks must have Route Advertisement enabled. For the `baremetal` network, the `radvd` daemon was used, while the `provisioning` network has RA enabled in the MetalÂ³ dnsmasq, so no configuration is needed.
