= BMC addressing for HPE

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

  baremetal:

For HPE hardware, Red Hat supports RedFish Virtual Media, RedFish, and IPMI.

.BMC address formats for HPE hardware
[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====
|Protocol|Address Format
|RedFish Virtual Media| `redfish-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1`

|IPMI| `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>`

See the following sections for additional details.

.RedFish Virtual Media for HPE

To enable RedFish Virtual Media for HPE servers, use `redfish-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. The following example demonstrates using RedFish Virtual Media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]

platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True
----

.RedFish for HPE

To enable RedFish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installer requires both the host name or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

          username: <user>
          password: <password>

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True
----

.IPMI

Hosts using IPMI use the `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>:<port>` address format, which defaults to port `623` if not specified. The following example demonstrates an IPMI configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]

platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>
          username: <user>
          password: <password>

[NOTE]
====
IPMI does not encrypt communications. It is suitable for use within a data center or over a secured network. Use RedFish for secure communications over geographically distributed data centers using insecure networks such as the Internet.
