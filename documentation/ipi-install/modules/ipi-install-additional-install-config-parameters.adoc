[id="hoststable"]
.Hosts

The `hosts` parameter is a list of separate bare metal assets that
should be used to build the cluster.

|===
|Name |Default |Description
| [[name]]`name` |  | The name of the BareMetalHost resource to associate with the details. e.g. `openshift-master-0`
| [[role]]`role` |  | Either `master` or `worker`.
| `bmc` | | Connection details for the baseboard management controller. xref:bmcadressing[See below for details.]
| [[bootMACAddress]]`bootMACAddress` |  | The MAC address of the NIC the host will use to boot on the provisioning network.
| [[hardwareProfile]]`hardwareProfile` | `default`|This parameter exposes the device name that the installer attempts to deploy the {product-title} for the master and worker nodes. The value defaults to `default` for masters and `unknown` for workers. The list of profiles includes: `default`, `libvirt`, `dell`, `dell-raid`, `openstack`. The `default` parameter attempts to install on `/dev/sda` of your cluster node.
|===

The `bmc` parameter for each host is a set of values for accessing the
baseboard management controller in the host.

|===
|Name |Default |Description
| `username` |  | The username for authenticating to the BMC.
| `password` |  | The password associated with `username`.

[id="bmcadressing"]
== BMC addressing

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL with details how to
connect to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of
controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

.IPMI

IPMI hosts use `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>:<port>` and defaults to port
`623` if not specified. Example output of using IPMI within your
`install-config.yaml` file.

----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

ifeval::[{release} > 4.4]

.RedFish

For RedFish, use `redfish://` (or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS).
The hostname (or IP address) and the path to the system ID are both
required. Example output of using RedFish within your
`install-config.yaml` file.

----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for your
out of band management addresses, if using self-signed certificates
ensure to include an additional parameter of
`disableCertificateVerification: True`. Example output of using
RedFish with `disableCertificateVerification: True`
within your `install-config.yaml` file.

----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True
----

NOTE: Currently RedFish is only supported on HPE hardware and
Dell with iDRAC firmware version `4.20.20.20` or higher for IPI on 
Bare metal deployments. We are working with other vendors to enable 
RedFish capabilities across the board. 

.RedFish Virtual Media

For RedFish virtual media, use `redfish-virtualmedia://`

Example output of using RedFish Virtual Media
within your `install-config.yaml` file.

    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
