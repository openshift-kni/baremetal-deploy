= Backing up the cluster configuration

At this point you have a working OpenShift 4 cluster on baremetal.
In order to take advantage of the baremetal hardware that was the provision node,
you can repurpose the provisioning node as a worker.
Prior to reprovisioning the node, it is recommended to backup some existing files.

.Procedure

. Tar the `clusterconfig` folder and download it to your local machine.
+
[source,bash]
----
tar cvfz clusterconfig.tar.gz ~/clusterconfig
----

. Copy the Private part for the SSH Key configured on the `install-config.yaml` file to your local machine.
+
[source,bash]
----
tar cvfz clusterconfigsh.tar.gz ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
----

. Copy the `install-config.yaml` and `metal3-config.yaml` files.
+
[source,bash]
----
tar cvfz yamlconfigs.tar.gz install-config.yaml metal3-config.yaml
----
