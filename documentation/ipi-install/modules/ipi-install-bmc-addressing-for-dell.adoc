= BMC addressing for Dell

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

For Dell hardware, Red Hat supports RedFish Virtual Media, RedFish, and IPMI.

.BMC address formats for Dell hardware
[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====
|Protocol|Address Format
|RedFish Virtual Media| `idrac-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
|RedFish|`redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
|IPMI|`ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>`
|====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol for RedFish Virtual Media. `redfish-virtualmedia` will NOT work on Dell hardware. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia` uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions.
====

See the following sections for additional details.

.RedFish Virtual Media for Dell

For RedFish Virtual Media on Dell servers, use `idrac-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will NOT work.

ifeval::[{release} >= 4.6]
ifeval::[{release} < 4.7]
[NOTE]
====
RedFish Virtual Media on Dell servers has a known issue in {product-title} 4.6, which will be resolved in the 4.6.1 point release.

The following example demonstrates using iDRAC Virtual Media within the  `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]

platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: idrac-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

          disableCertificateVerification: True

[NOTE]
====
Currently RedFish is only supported on Dell with iDRAC firmware versions `4.20.20.20` through `04.40.00.00` for IPI on bare metal deployments. There is a known issue with version `04.40.00.00`. With iDRAC 9 firmware version `04.40.00.00`, the Virtual Console plug-in defaults to `eHTML5`, which causes problems with the *InsertVirtualMedia* workflow. Set the plug-in to `HTML5` to avoid this issue. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual console* -> *Plug-in Type* -> *HTML5* .

Ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have AutoAttach Enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> *AutoAttach* .

Use `idrac-virtualmedia://` as the protocol for RedFish Virtual Media. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will NOT work on Dell hardware, because the `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol corresponds to the `idrac` hardware type and the Redfish protocol in Ironic. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions. Ironic also supports the `idrac` type with the WSMAN protocol. So you must specify `idrac-virtualmedia://` to avoid unexpected behavior when electing to use RedFish with Virtual Media on Dell hardware.

.RedFish for Dell

To enable RedFish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installer requires both the host name or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]

The `redfish://`` URL protocol corresponds to the `redfish` hardware type in Ironic.
====


.IPMI

Hosts using IPMI use the `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>:<port>` address format, which defaults to port `623` if not specified. The following example demonstrates an IPMI configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]

    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

[NOTE]
====
IPMI does not encrypt communications. It is suitable for use within a data center or over a secured network. Use RedFish for secure communications over geographically distributed data centers using insecure networks such as the Internet.
