= Installing RHEL on the provision node

With the networking portions complete, the next step in installing the {product-title} cluster is to
install RHEL 8 on the provision node.
This node will be used as the orchestrator in installing the OCP cluster on the three master and two worker nodes.
For the purposes of this document, installing RHEL on the provision node is out of scope. However, options include,
but are not limited to, using a RHEL Satellite server, PXE, or installation media.
