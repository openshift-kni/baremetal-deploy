= Using `become: yes` within `ansible.cfg` or inside `playbook.yml`

This Ansible playbook takes advantage of the `ansible_user_dir`
variable. As such, it is important to note that if within your
`ansible.cfg` or within the `playbook.yml` file the privilege
escalation of `become: yes` is used, this will modify the home
directory to that of the root user (i.e. `/root`) instead of using the
home directory of your privileged user, `kni` with a home directory of
`/home/kni`
