= Prerequisites

* Best Practice Minimum Setup: 6 Physical servers (1 provision node, 3 master and 2 worker nodes)
* Best Practice Minimum Setup for disconnected environments: 7 Physical servers (1 provision node, 1 registry nodefootnote:registry[If creating the mirrored registry, this system will require online access. The registry node may be a virtual machine in order to reduce physical server footprint.], 3 master and 2 worker nodes)
* Minimum Setup: 4 Physical servers (1 provision node, 3 master nodes)
* Minimum Setup for disconnected environments: 5 Physical servers (1 provision node, 1 registry nodefootnote:registry[], 3 master nodes)
* Each server needs 2 NICs pre-configured. NIC1 for the private network and NIC2 for the baremetal network. NIC interface names must be identical across all nodesfootnote:issue[https://github.com/openshift/installer/issues/2762]
* It is recommended each server have a RAID-1 configured and initialized (though not enforced)
* Each server must have IPMI configured
* Each server must have DHCP setup for the baremetal NICs
* Each server must have DNS setup for the API, wildcard applications
* A DNS VIP is IP on the `baremetal` network is required for reservation. Reservation is done via our DHCP server (though not required).
* Optional - Include DNS entries for the hostnames for each of the servers
* Download a copy of your https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/user-provisioned[Pull Secret]

Due to the complexities of properly configuring an environment, it is
recommended to review the following steps prior to running the Ansible
playbook as without proper setup, the Ansible playbook won't work.

The section to review and ensure proper configuration are as follows:

Once the above is complete, install Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.x on your provision node and create a user (i.e. `kni`) to deploy as non-root and provide that user `sudo` privileges.


For simplicity, the steps to create the user named `kni` is as follows:

. Login into the provision node via `ssh`

. Create a user (i.e `kni`) to deploy as non-root and provide that user `sudo` privileges
+
[source,sh]
----
useradd kni
passwd kni
echo "kni ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL" | tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/kni
chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/kni
----
+
. Enable a `dnf` <<local_repository,local repository>> on the provision host

. Manually install <<packages,`python3-crypto` and `python3-pyghmi`>> packages on the provision host
