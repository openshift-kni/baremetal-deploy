= Pre-caching RHCOS Images

If you wish to set up a local cache of RHCOS images on your
provisioning host, set the `cache_enabled` variable to `True` in your
hosts file. When requested, the playbook will pre-download RHCOS
images prior to actual cluster deployment.

It places these images in an Apache web server container on the
provisioning host and modifies `install-config.yaml` to
instruct the bootstrap VM to download the images from that web server
during deployment.

[WARNING]
====
If you set the `clusterosimage` and `bootstraposimage` variables,
then `cache_enabled` will automatically be set to `False`. Setting
these variables leaves the responsibility to the end user in ensuring
the RHCOS images are readily available and accessible to the provision
host.
