[appendix]
= Using a proxy with your Ansible playbook

When running behind a proxy, it is important to properly set the environment
to handle such scenario such that you can run the Ansible playbook. In order
to use a proxy for the ansible playbook set the appropriate variables within
your `inventory/hosts` file. These values will also be included within your
generated `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,bash]
----
# (Optional) Provide HTTP proxy settings
#http_proxy=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:8080

# (Optional) Provide HTTPS proxy settings
#https_proxy=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:8080

# (Optional) comma-separated list of hosts, IP Addresses, or IP ranges in CIDR format
# excluded from proxying
# NOTE: OpenShift does not accept '*' as a wildcard attached to a domain suffix
# i.e. *.example.com
# Use '.' as the wildcard for a domain suffix as shown in the example below.
# i.e. .example.com
#no_proxy_list="172.22.0.0/24,.example.com"
