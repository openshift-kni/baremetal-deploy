= Modifying the `inventory/hosts` file for Fully Disconnected Deployments

While there are many https://github.com/openshift-kni/baremetal-deploy/blob/master/ansible-ipi-install/README.md#modifying-the-inventoryhosts-file[options] that may be set when deploying IPI on baremetal

registry node are shown below

# Provide the webserver URL as shown below if using fully disconnected
webserver_url=http://example.com:8080'
