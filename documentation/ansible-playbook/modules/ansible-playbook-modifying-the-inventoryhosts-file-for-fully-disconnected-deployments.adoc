= Modifying the `inventory/hosts` file for Fully Disconnected Deployments

//FIXME link
While there are many link:../../{release}/Deployment#ipi-install-configuration-files[options] 
that may be set when deploying IPI on baremetal using the Ansible 
playbook. This portion will strictly focus on what are the

[source,ini]

# Provide the webserver URL as shown below if using fully disconnected
webserver_url=http://example.com:8080'

[registry_host:vars]
