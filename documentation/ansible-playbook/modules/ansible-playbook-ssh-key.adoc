= Copy local SSH key to provision node

With the `ansible.cfg` file in place, the next step is
to ensure to copy your public `ssh` key to your provision
 node using `ssh-copy-id`.

From the system that is to run the playbook,

[source,bash]
----
$ ssh-copy-id <user>@provisioner.example.com
----

NOTE: <user> should be the user previously created on the provision node (i.e. `kni`)
