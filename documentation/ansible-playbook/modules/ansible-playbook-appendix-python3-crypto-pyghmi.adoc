== Installing `python3-crypto` and `python3-pyghmi`

The Ansible playbook uses the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ipmi_power_module.html[`ipmi_power`]
module to power off the OpenShift cluster nodes prior to deployment. This 
particular module has a dependency for two packages: 
`python3-crypto` and `python3-pyghmi`. When using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 
these packages do not reside in BaseOS nor AppStream repositories. If using 
`subscription-manager`, they reside in the OpenStack repositories such as
`openstack-16-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms`, however, to simplify the installation
of these packages, the playbook uses the available versions from 
`trunk.rdoproject.org`.

The playbook assumes that the rpm packages are manually installed on 
provision host.  

When the provision host packages are
not already installed on the system, the following error can be expected

```sh
TASK [node-prep : Install required packages] ************************************************************************************************
Thursday 07 May 2020  19:11:35 +0000 (0:00:00.161)       0:00:11.940 ********** 
fatal: [provisioner.example.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failures": ["No package python3-crypto available.", "No package python3-pyghmi available."], "msg": "Failed to install some of the specified packages", "rc": 1, "results": []}
```

The `python3-crypto` and `python3-pyghmi` can be downloaded from the following
links for install on an offline provision host and transferred locally for local install of the rpms.
