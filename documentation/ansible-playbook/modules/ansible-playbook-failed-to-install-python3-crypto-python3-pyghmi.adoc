= Failed to install `python3-crypto` & `python3-pyghmi`

The Ansible playbook uses the
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ipmi_power_module.html[`ipmi_power`]
module to power off the OpenShift cluster nodes prior to deployment.
This particular module has a dependency for two packages:
`python3-crypto` and `python3-pyghmi`. When using Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 8, these packages do not reside in BaseOS nor AppStream
repositories. If using `subscription-manager`, they reside in the
OpenStack repositories such as `openstack-16-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms`,
however, to simplify the installation of these packages, the playbook
uses the available versions from `trunk.rdoproject.org`.

The playbook assumes that the provision host can access
`trunk.rdoproject.org` or that the rpm packages are manually installed
on provision host.

When the provision host cannot reach `trunk.rdopoject.org` and the
packages are not already installed on the system, the following error
can be expected

[source,bash]

====
The `python3-crypto` and `python3-pyghmi` can be downloaded from the
following links if required for an offline provision host:
