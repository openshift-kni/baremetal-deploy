= Adding Extra Configurations to the OpenShift Installer

Prior to the installation of Red Hat OpenShift, you may want to include
additional configuration files to be included during the installation.
The `installer` role handles this.

In order to include the `extraconfigs`, ensure to place your `yaml`
files within the `roles/installer/files/manifests` directory. All the
files provided here will be included when the OpenShift manifests are
created.

NOTE: By default this directory is empty.
