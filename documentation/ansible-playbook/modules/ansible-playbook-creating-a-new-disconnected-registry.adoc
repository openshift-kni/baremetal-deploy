= Creating a new disconnected registry

To create a new disconnected registry, the 
`disconnected_registry_auths_file` and 
`disconnected_registry_mirrors_file` variables must not be set.

The certificate information used to generate the host certificate must 
be defined. These variables must be defined as variables to the 
`registry_host` group in the inventory file.
