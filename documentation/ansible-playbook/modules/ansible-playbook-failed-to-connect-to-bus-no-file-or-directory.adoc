= Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory

The Ansible playbook creates two containers (when enabled) to 
store a mirored registry and a caching webserver. 
When these containers are created, the playbook also creates a
`systemd` unit file to ensure these containers are restarted upon
the reboot of the host serving them. 

Since these are `systemd` user services, when logging into a
system to attempt a command such as
`systemctl --user status container-cache.service` for the
webserver or `systemctl --user status container-registry.service`
for the mirrored registry, you may get an error such as:

----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ systemctl --user status container-cache
Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory
----

What the following error is trying to address is that the 
parameter, `DBUS_SESSIONBUS_ADDRESS`, is not set. 

In order to set this variable, we can `export` as follows:

----
export DBUS_SESSIONBUS_ADDRESS="unix:path/run/user/$id/bus"
----

Once that has been set, if you re-attempt the `systemctl` command, you should
see output as follows:

----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ systemctl --user status container-cache.service
