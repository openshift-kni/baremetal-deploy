= `git` clone the Ansible playbook

The first step to using the Ansible playbook is to clone the
https://github.com/openshift-kni/baremetal-deploy/[baremetal-deploy] repository.

NOTE: This should be done on a system that can access the provision host

. Clone the `git` repository
+
[source,bash]
----
[user@laptop ~]$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/openshift-kni/baremetal-deploy.git
----
+
NOTE: Ensure `git` is installed on your localhost and that `--recursive` is used to initialize the git submodules.
+
. Change to the `ansible-ipi-install` directory
+
[source,bash]
----
[user@laptop ~]$ cd /path/to/git/repo/baremetal-deploy/ansible-ipi-install
----
