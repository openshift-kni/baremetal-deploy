When dealing with issues of OpenShift cluster nodes not
PXE booting the following issues should be further verified:

* Check the network connectivity to your `+Provisioning+`
Network
* Make sure to have PXE enabled on the provisioning NIC and PXE disabled
for all other NICs.
* Verify you have the proper boot MAC address(provisioning NIC MAC
address) and hardware profiles in `+install-config.yaml+` file.
