= Servers not getting the correct IPv6 from the DHCP

When not getting the correct IPv6 from the DHCP on your OpenShift Nodes
you need to verify a few things:

1. The reserved IPv6 should be outside the DHCP IPv6 range configured
2. Make sure you are using the correct DUID for the reservation
3. Make sure Router Advertisements are enabled
4. Make sure the DHCP server is listening on the correct interface
