= Cleaning up previous installations

In the event there was a previous failed attempted of deployment, run the following steps in order to remove any old artifacts from the failed attempt.

. Ensure all bare metal nodes are powered off prior to installing the {product-title} cluster.
+
[source,bash]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ ipmitool -I lanplus -U <user> -P <password> -H <management-server-ip> power off
----

. Ensure that old bootstrap resources are removed, if any are left over from a previous deployment attempt.
+
[source,bash]
----
for i in $(sudo virsh list | tail -n +3 | grep bootstrap | awk {'print $2'});
do
  sudo virsh destroy $i;
  sudo virsh undefine $i;
  sudo virsh vol-delete $i --pool default;
  sudo virsh vol-delete $i.ign --pool default;
done
----

. The folder `clusterconfigs` should remove the following files and directories to prevent Terraform from failing as it may reference older deployments if these files are still available.
+
[source,bash]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ rm -rf ~/clusterconfigs/auth ~/clusterconfigs/terraform* ~/clusterconfigs/tls ~/clusterconfigs/metadata.json
