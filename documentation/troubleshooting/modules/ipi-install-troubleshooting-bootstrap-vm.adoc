= Bootstrap VM issues

The bootstrap node is a virtual machine that is triggered by the
OpenShift installer that handles the provisioning of the nodes that will
be part of the OpenShift cluster.

Once the deployment is triggered (may take 10 to 15 minutes) we
can see if the Bootstrap VM is operational. We can verify the bootstrap
VM is operational via the `+virsh+` command.

[source,bash]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo virsh list
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 12    kni7-xf6fq-bootstrap           running
----

NOTE: The name of the bootstrap VM is always the clustername, followed
by random set of characters and ending in the word bootstrap.

If no bootstrap VM is running after waiting 10-15 minutes, it is
important to troubleshoot as to why it was not created. Possible issues
to verify are:

* Verify `+libvirtd+` is running on the system

[source,bash]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ systemctl status libvirtd
● libvirtd.service - Virtualization daemon

If the bootstrap VM is indeed operational, we want to verify if we can
log into it.

We can find the IP address of the bootstrap VM using the
`+virsh console+` command as shown.

[source,bash]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo virsh console kni7-4q49b-bootstrap

* Once the IP address has been obtained, we can attempt to login to the
bootstrap VM using the `+ssh+` command.

[NOTE]
====
In the console output above, the IPv6 IP provided by `ens3` or the
IPv4 IP provided by `ens4` can be used.

[source,bash]

[kni@provisioner ~]$ ssh core@172.22.0.2

If attempting to log into the bootstrap VM and you are not successful,
you’ve likely reached one of the following scenarios:

* Cannot reach the `+172.22.0.0/24+` network. This means you should
verify your connectivity on the provisioning host specifically around
the provisioning network bridge
* Cannot reach the bootstrap VM via the public network. When attempting
to SSH via baremetal network you should verify your connectivity on the
provisioning host specifically around the baremetal network bridge.
* `+Permission denied (publickey,password,keyboard-interactive)+`. When
attempting to access the bootstrap VM an error of Permission denied
might occur, verify that your SSH key for the user attempting to log
into the VM is set within your `+install-config.yaml+` file.
