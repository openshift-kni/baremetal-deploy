[[api]]
= API not accessible

When the API is not accessible these issues often arise when the
following is not properly addressed.

* Incorrect name resolutions are set in the DNS server,
make use of `+dig+` and `+nslookup+` commands.
* `+SSH+` into the OpenShift cluster and make sure they are getting the
FQDN and not just `+localhost.localdomain+`.

For example, if we wanted to verify the API VIP was properly set via
`dig`, we could:

[source,bash]
----
dig api.<cluster-name>.example.com
; <<>> DiG 9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-26.P2.el8 <<>> api.<cluster-name>.example.com

This concludes that the appropriate IP for the
api.<cluster-name>.example.com VIP was `10.19.13.86`.
This IP address should reside on the `baremetal` network.
