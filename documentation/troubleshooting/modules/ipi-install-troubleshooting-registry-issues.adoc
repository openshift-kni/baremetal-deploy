= Registry Issues

At times, there may be a need to create a disconnected registry due to
limited connectivity to an environment or creating a central location to
host images locally. Details can be found in link:Deployment#ipi-install-creating-a-disconnected-registry_ipi-install-prerequisites[Creating a disconnected registry]

When attempting to mirror the registry and if you receive a 'User Not Authorized'
error, this is due to not appending the new authentication to your already
existing pull-secret.txt file.

[source,bash]
----
[kni@registry ~]$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
     --from=${PRODUCT_REPO}/${PROJECT}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}

User Not Authorized
----

After the registry is mirrored, confirm that you can access this in your
disconnected environment

[source,bash]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ curl -k -u <user>:<password> https://registry.example.com:<registry-port>/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":["<Repo-Name>"]}
