= Registry Issues

At times, there may be a need to create a disconnected registry due to
limited connectivity to an environment or creating a central location to
host images locally. Details can be found in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.html#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[Create a Disconnected Registry]

*Note:* While Mirroring the registry using `+oc adm release mirror+`
command, please make sure to add the additional `+registry.svc.io+`
token to your pull-secret.json file
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.html#Procedure[Add-Token]

In the pull-secret.json file make sure to add a section for

[source,json]
----
    "registry.example.com:<registry-port>": {
      "auth": "a25pOmtuaQ==",
      "email": "<your-email-id>"
    },
----

otherwise the mirroring process fails with

[source,bash]
----
oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
     --from=${PRODUCT_REPO}/${PROJECT}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}

User Not Authorized
----

After the registry is mirrored, confirm that you can access this in your
disconnected environment

[source,bash]
----
# curl -k -u <user>:<password> https://registry.example.com:<registry-port>/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":["<Repo-Name>"]}
----
