# Performance Tuning

All manifests should be applied automatically on a new cluster via `make deploy`, in case if you want to test each feature separately, refer to the feature section.

## Environment variables

This is a list of environment variables that you should export before running `make generate`.

- `ISOLATED_CPUS` - CPU's that you want to isolate from the system usage.
- `RESERVED_CPUS` - CPU's that you want to reserve for the system and does not use for containers workloads.

## Huge Pages

To verify huge pages feature functionality:

- label your worker nodes with `oc label node <node_name> machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role=worker-rt`
- run `make generate`
- apply huge pages kernel boot parameters config via `oc create -f manifests/generated/02-machine-config-worker-rt-kargs.yaml`
- wait for workers update

```bash
oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator wait machineconfigpools worker --for condition=Updating --timeout=1800s
oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator wait machineconfigpools worker --for condition=Updated --timeout=1800s
```

- create the huge pages pod via `oc create -f examples/hugepages-pod.yaml`
- get pod UID by running `oc get pods -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,UID:.metadata.uid,HOST_IP:.status.hostIP`
- now you can find the specific cgroup under the host where the pod is running and check hugepages limit `cat /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb/kubepods.slice/kubepods-pod<pod_uid>.slice/hugetlb.1GB.limit_in_bytes`
- under the pod you can check the huge pages mount `mount | grep hugepages`

## RT kernel

The realtime kernel will be installed using MachineConfig, which installs a new systemd unit, which runs a script.
The template for the `MachineConfig` placed under `manifests/templates` and the script located in `assets`. The actual manifest is created by running `make generate`,
which will base64 encode the script and put it into the template. The result is stored under `manifests/generated`.
